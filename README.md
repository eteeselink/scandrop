ScanDrop
========

A Windows Phone 8 application that helps you
* Take a picture
* Choose a filename
* Store it on dropbox
All with minimal user interaction.

Made purely for my own purposes. Code quality is pretty awful,
but the thing works. If you're a MVVM nazi, this code will give you
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">the shivers</span>.

A use case
----------

I'm a one man company, and I want to reduce administrative
overhead for little receipts of small purchases (business 
lunches, USB cables, etc). 

ScanDrop allows me to take a picture of a receipt, put administrative
info (date, location, amount, taxes, etc) *right inside* the filename,
and beam it to Dropbox. The paper receipt is then unceremoneously dumped
in a big box, the digital version is the one that counts.

I use the data from the filename as entries for my administration system,
with a little script. This way, I don't at all need to do any further
administrative work for these little receipt other than using ScanDrop,
right after I made the purchase.
